# Venti

Venti, is a platform where people can anonymously cheer people up, or vent to others and tell them about your days, where you will receive support from other people anonymously. These posts will show to other users based on how sad the post seems. We trained an AI to learn and compare sadness levels on the posts made by the users, and then it provides the users with posts that have the highest levels of sadness will show up first, so the people that seem to need the most support, will obtain it. Additionally, we also recommend to users posts that are similar to theirs by analyzing the similarly of the content of the users posts and others and recommending posts that are similar to a user. This is done so that users who may be feeling sad about a particular thing know that they are not the only one having the same experience.
